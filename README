Salty Frontend Bootstrap
=======

This is a basic bootstrap for a frontend site. It uses Gulp as a task runner,
Foundation as the CSS framework and SASS as a CSS pre-processor.

## Setup

All that needs to be setup is to run the following:

```sh
npm install && bower install
```
Running the default gulp task will all of the necessary tasks and then the
watcher.

**Might need to be done as sudo if npm install fails.**
